# About Me

Hi, I’m **Jason Vanderburg** — a data-minded problem-solver with a sharp eye for patterns, a bias for clarity, and a strong sense of ethics.

After years of working in the real world — from logistics to leadership to lived experience — I’ve come to believe that **good data and clear communication can change everything**.

I'm currently pursuing a degree in *Computer Information Systems*, building a portfolio that reflects what matters to me:  
mental health, justice, transparency, and tools that actually help people.

When I’m not analyzing datasets or experimenting with new tech, you’ll probably find me troubleshooting something in the driveway, mentoring my kids, or asking why we ever normalized clickbait dashboards.

I’m not looking to work for companies that chase profit at the expense of people.  
**I care about meaningful work, practical solutions, and leaving things better than we found them.**

Want to know more or see what I’ve been building?
